# Avatar RPG (unit-4 game)

#### Welcome to Avatar The Last Airbender RPG. This game consists of four of the main characters from the hit TV show. They each have a different class element - air, water, fire, and earth. 

#### In this game, each element has strengths and weakness. For instance, fire is stronger than earth, earth is stronger than wind, wind is stronger than water, and water is stronger than fire. The game uses these factors and gives fighters advantages or disadvantages according to who they are up against.
